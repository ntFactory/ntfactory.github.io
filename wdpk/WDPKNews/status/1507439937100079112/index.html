  	      The merchandise on <a href="http://edbangerrecords.bandcamp.com/">http://edbangerrecords.bandcamp.com/</a> has also disappeared.<br><br>Specific artist stores on the label, including physical albums and merch sold on artist websites and Bandcamp, are still available.<br>I believe those are handled through a different company.
